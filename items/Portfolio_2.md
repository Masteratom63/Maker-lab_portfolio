### Project 2 - Group Maker Project 1 (GMP1)
For GMP1 we decided to make a storage box with security, which is kept on the porch and is used to accept parcels or food deliveries </br>
We named that project as **"Porch Private"** as it privately stores our parcels and it is kept on the porch. </br>
The images for it are displayed below, and the images go from initial starting stage to the final product: </br>
