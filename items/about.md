## About Me

I am a student at Wilfrid Laurier University, and I am majoring in User Experience Design (Bachelor of Design). </br>
I am making this website for the portfolio assignment for the class of UX201. </br>
And the contact info in the contact part is not real so please don't try and contact it. </br>
I didn't add the real contact info because some times the contact info is copied by some scammers and they try and scam the contact number and contact email.
